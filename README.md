The ```slotting``` folder focuses on a slotting problem, which is common in warehouse management. The goal is to assign products to storage locations in order to minimize picking costs.

The problem is modeled as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP) and solved using PySpark DataFrames in Databricks Community Edition, demonstrating how large-scale data can be integrated with optimization techniques.
